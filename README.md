# ASCII Raider

> This project is a puzzle game based on 'Crypt Raider', where your objective in each level is to push one or more 'keys' to the 'exit door'. In order to travel through the different chambers, you must push boulders along the map, escape all the enemies and avoid the explosions that may be triggered by interacting with explosive elements. Think fast, think smart, and try to beat the timer to gain more points in each completed level.
